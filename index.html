        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This glossary contains some 50 technical terms on mining, metallurgy and structures within the industry that were in use in 19th century southwest China. It is based on a memorial entitled “Inspection of the Situation in the Mines and Trial Implementation of Exploitation Development” 查勘礦廠情形試行開採摺, which Lin Zexu 林則徐 (1785–1850) and Cheng Yucai 程矞采 (1783-1858), the officials presiding the provincial government of Yunnan province, submitted to the throne in March 1849. The text is a core source on silver mining in Yunnan province during the Qing period and a text marking the end of a textualization process of mining knowledge that can be traced from the late 17th century onward.
            The glossary is part of a systematic history of terms that covers the available body of texts on mining in southwest China. It provides my translation of all technical terms in the memorial text. The background to my interpretation is provided in commentaries to each term and linked occurrences in other texts.

            2.	You can use the glossary like a dictionary, searching alphabetically by pronunciation. ->link

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
         The mining terminology that appears in government records of Yunnan province from the early 18th to the mid-19th centuries is a rare case in which the textualization of technological knowledge in late imperial China becomes visible. It raises intriguing questions regarding the formation of mining expertise among ranked officials and their informal staff on the local, provincial and central levels of government. The regional geographic focus, moreover, invites researching to which extent terminologies reflect an integrated empirewide exchange of technologies or continuations of regional traditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The research aims to evaluate:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The stability of mining terms in government records.</li>
            <li>The level of textualization in Yunnan's mining administration before modernization.</li>
            <li>The interplay between local traditions and integrated technological exchanges across the empire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The core text on mining terminology is first section in Diannan kuangchang tulue 滇南礦廠圖略, the handbook of the Yunnan mining administration that Wu Qijun 吳其濬 commissioned in 1844. This text, which I attribute to Xu Jinsheng 徐金生, consists a topical descriptive glossary of some 200 terms, accompanied by annotated illustrations. This project is built to allow expanding to cover this text by minor adjustments in the structure.

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <p> 
           The memorial of 1849 has been transmitted in several editions that slightly diverge in a few rare characters. In all cases in doubt, this investigation follows the archive copy of the original memorial that was produced for presentation at court and deposited in the Qing imperial archive. This copy, which is preserved in the First Archive in Beijing is published as photographic reproduction in Qinggong Lin Zexu dang'an huibian 清宮林則徐檔案匯編, vol. 10, 97-117. The interpunctuation draws on Lin Zexu quanji 林则徐全集 2002, part Zouzhe 奏折, vol. 4, 493-500. The original text is unstructured. I have used the subdivision into paragraphs that Zheng Zhenduo 鄭振鐸 added in WanQing wenxuan, with one added subdivision.

        <h2>Additional Sources</h2> <!--komplett beibehalten oder einlisten?-->
        <p>The analysis uses 12 earlier texts that contain technical terms and evidently or highly probably were available to the authors of the 1849 memorial. Occurrences in these texts allow tracing the formation of terms. The earliest of these is the chapter on silver metallurgy in Song Yinxing’s 宋應星 encyclopaedia Tiangong kaiwu” 天工開物. This late Ming text, which is not geographically defined but records some Yunnannese technologies, mainly serves as a reference to older terminology that was, however, known to the memorial authors. The earliest Qing source is an only vaguely dated description of the silver and tin mines of Gejiu that was included in the 1712 local gazetteer of Mengzi. It probably dates to the period of compilation, although a considerably early period as far back as the late Ming cannot be excluded. Relatively specific records begin in the 1770s with a surviving excerpt from a lost handbook of the provincial copper administration. To compare usage in earlier memorials, two examples of 1777 and 1795 have been included. Further specific records composed by officials or in the context of government tasks but not for administrative purposes are two articles on mining and smelting and two poems. The lates included text is a report by Huang Mengju 黄梦菊, the magistrate of Huize county in northeastern Yunnan of about 1845.

        In addition, I include a later text by Song Gengping 宋賡平, a Western-educated mining engineer, who recorded traditional technologies that he observed in western Sichuan around 1900 in a textbook to be used at a mining school in Chongqing. The work by an outsider to the traditional world of mining and metallurgy with scientific knowledge and linguistic understanding is of invaluable help for understanding late premodern mining technologies and terminologies in the region. Because western Sichuan borders on northeastern and northern Yunnan, the region may be regarded as continuous in terms of technologies and terminologies.

                    and presumably obtained much of his information on silver metallurgy here. The genesis of the text
                    may be roughly dated to the 1620s to early 1630s. Some sources may be older. Song may have combined
                    older ters with current terms from different regions, probably mainly from his native Jiangxi and
                    adjoining regions and Yunnan. The annotated edition in DNKCTL adds annotations that explain Song’s
                    terminology by current Yunnanese terms.

                    1700 to 1720. The text therefore dates no later than 1710. Clearly written by a member of the local
                    administration as a description of the mining area, the text is unusually long and detailed. It may
                    have been produced in the context of the gazetteer preparation or already held in the local
                    government as a aid in monitoring the mines. </p>
                    <p>Two details might indicate that it was older: </p>
                    <p>First, the text specifies that Gejiu is a xiang 鄉 subcounty and that the inhabitants of the main
                        village Gejiu or the entire area were registered in the baojia system. Because Qing gazetteers
                        record no xiang of this name and the baojia system was not much emphasized in the Qing
                        administration of Yunnan, this might date the text to the late Ming.</p>
                    <p>Second, the description on mining activities in the text diverges from the following taxation
                        records. This might indicate a time gap between the text and the taxation records, which can be
                        safely dated to the late Kangxi period. I have not analysed this divergence in detail.</p>

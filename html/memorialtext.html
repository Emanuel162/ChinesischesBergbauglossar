            Note on the text:
            The text is a transcription of the facsimile reproduction of the manuscript copy from the imperial archive
            in
            <em>Qinggong
                Lin Zexu dang'an huibian</em>, vol. 10, 97-117. This text diverges in a few characters from the version
            in
            <em>Lin
                Wenzhong gong zhengshu</em> 林文忠公政書, <em>Huangchao jingshiwen tongbian</em> 皇朝經世文統編 and <em>WanQing
            wenxuan</em> 晚清文選 (Lin Zexu 2002, Shao Zhitang 1901, Zheng Zhenduo 1937).
            I have used the subdivision into paragraphs of <em>WanQing wenxuan</em> 晚清文選, and the interpunctuation
            of
            <em>Lin
                Zexu quanji</em> 2002, part <em>Zouzhe</em> 奏折, vol. 4, 493-500. I have added one subdivision in the
            twelfth
            paragraph of <em>WanQing wenxuan</em>. This results in a total of 27 paragraphs. For quick reference, the
            paragraph
            numbers are added.

                        <p>From ministerial communications and imperial edicts, which we humbly perused and received, we
                            learnt
                            of the palace memorial by the Ministry of Finance on the preparation of treasury holdings,
                            upon
                            which the Imperial Clan Court, The Grand Secretariat and the Grand Council held consultation
                            and
                            jointly memorialized. Hereupon five statutes have been proposed, which all concern benefits
                            derived
                            from natural resources, measuring their detrimental and beneficial effects. Now, the
                            provincial
                            governors, in accordance with the situation in their localities, following thorough
                            consultation
                            and
                            counsel, have set up further statutes, which all have been reported in joint memorials. In
                            awe
                            we
                            praise our emperor who takes his intentions of enriching our state and ensuring the daily
                            needs
                            of
                            our people, of making use of benefits to better their well-being to the fullest.</p>
                        <p>We have repeatedly studied the new five statutes: Among them are matters, such as the state
                            grain
                            transport system, that do not apply to Yunnan, the salt gabelle with long-established
                            statutes
                            and
                            no issues of above-quota salt tickets or lost tax revenues that has observed all command and
                            requires no change. Regarding the land and poll tax, as well as the annual clearance of
                            accounts,
                            all is handled by “full collection, full remittance,” with no arrears. Beyond the
                            supervision of
                            account-keeping, the observation of deadlines, truthful reporting, and unified procedures,
                            of
                            all
                            matters that Yunnan ought to undertake, mining is of paramount importance. We would not dare
                            to
                            allow the slightest negligence here.</p>

                        <p>We have repeatedly pondered matters of earth and wealth, that commercial products resent
                            being
                            left
                            idle in the land, whereas by profiting from these benefits, the wealth is still stored among
                            the
                            people. Indeed, when managed well, expanding these [benefits] without ill effects is
                            possible.
                            Consulting the <em>Zhouli</em>, [it defines] ‘kuangren: [the official] in charge of land of
                            metals,
                            jade, and tinstone.’ The commentary explains “kuang” as “ore”. Thus, where [the classic]
                            says
                            ‘protect it by strict access ban,’ this refers to unexploited ore [deposits]. [The classic
                            further]
                            says that ‘it is to be extracted in timely manner, so that material that in the soil is
                            desired
                            may
                            be obtained, subsequently [resuming] bans and orders.’ Thus it elucidates the method for
                            mining
                            exploitation for later ages to emulate and follow.</p>

                    <td>Commentaries on timeliness only explain the general meaning. Now our inquiries in Yunnan found
                        further
                        evidence: It appears to refer to the dry season during winter and spring. This presumably is
                        because
                        metal is the mother of water, and therefore caves that produce the five metals invariable
                        require
                        lifting water before ore can be extracted. For this reason, copper workings customarily levy
                        drainage
                        fees, as do silver mines. When workings suffer from excessive water during summer and autumn,
                        draining
                        them becomes highly difficult, and in many cases interrupting operation. When there is too much
                        water
                        and nowhere to drain it to, rich ore is drowned and workings will be abandoned. We thus had the
                        revelation that by “timely” the ancients recognized these conditions long ago.

                    <td>The meaning of the phrase “material that in the soil is desired may be obtained” is just like
                        present-day prospecting for ore: This begins with searching for full-bodied mountains with
                        strong
                        earth
                        veins and lush turf, where veins protrude; at such a site a mine may be developed. A saying in
                        Yunnan
                        goes “one mountain with ore, a thousand with veins.” The veins first discovered are called “baby
                        seams”.
                        Those that lead on are called “regular seams,” where entering the mountain to extract the ore
                        becomes
                        worthwhile. Orebodies in the shape of sheets are called “swipe,” when workings widen out they
                        are
                        called
                        “halls.” Only these will make [a mine] prosperous. Mixed soil and rock is called “loose gangue,”
                        causing
                        frequent interruption and easily leading to costs exceeding returns. Even worse, is an opening
                        below
                        and
                        pressure from above, colloquially called “under the bedcovers” in Yunnan, as in this situation

                        effort
                        will lead to benefits. For these reasons, surveying has to be undertaken with great care. This
                        precisely
                        is meant by “material that in the soil is desired may be obtained.”

                    <td>The “bans and orders” undoubtedly address the large numbers of people in a mine that require apt
                        policing. In the mines nowadays, they set up tax master, guest master, mine master, furnace
                        master,
                        timbering master, and pot boss, who are all in charge of restraining the masses of ditch and
                        adit
                        households, the furnace workers and miners. In addition, many clerks, runners, police- and
                        militiamen
                        have to be sent in to prevent theft and tax evasion, as well as to suppress fights over [claim]
                        bottoms
                        and adits. All these measures are implied in the bans and orders. Thus, the activity of mining
                        not
                        only
                        has been regulated in regulations through the dynasties, but find classic elucidation already in
                        the

                        bans
                        did not exist. The simple people follow profit as ducks, where ore is abundant they will come
                        unrequested, when it is exhausted the will leave without being driven away. Nothing will

                        benevolent edict has instructed us to control from afar. All officials, merchants, gentry and
                        commoners
                        are deeply grateful for this, and will find good and lasting solutions for management according

                        local
                        conditions. According to consulted documents, operating a mine requires great sums up front to

                        his
                        own.
                        An official taking on operation has the power to make his orders followed, yet the durations of
                        official
                        appointment vary greatly, hence it is to be feared that entanglements and even conflict will

                        upon
                        handing over to the next incumbent. Punitive extension of tenure in case of leaving a deficit

                        pretext for [extracting surcharges] as compensatory funds, setting even more harmful negative
                        examples.
                        Moreover, as local magistrates manage many things; they cannot possibly themselves reside in the
                        mines
                        and grow callouses on their hands and feet. They have no choice but to rely on private
                        secretaries
                        or
                        servants, clerks and runners, which inevitably involves even more graft. It thus appears rather
                        commendable [for the official] to call upon commoner merchants to congregate, leaving it to
                        their
                        joint-stock fellowships to jointly run operations, to award them when these are successful and
                        not
                        hold
                        them responsible when they discontinue operations. With officials empowered of supervision but
                        not
                        troubled by having to compensate for shortfalls, it appears that steady operation without abuses
                        is
                        possible.

                    <td>First, relaxing of the ban on [trade in] lead. Investigations have shown that “frying ore” is
                        the
                        best
                        ore exploited by silver mines, as it forms clean pieces with high silver content is high and
                        yielding
                        silver of high purity. But in a mine, not one in a hundred [of such pieces of ore] may be
                        obtained.
                        The
                        frequently seen ores are called “large flower” and “fine flower” silver ores, in fact all lead
                        ores.
                        Of
                        100 <em>jin</em> of these lead ores, half [of this weight] is lead extractable in smelting
                        provided
                        that
                        it is good ore. From 10 <em>jin</em> of good lead, cupellation in hoods will produce 0.6 to 0.7
                        <em>liang</em>
                        silver, while only 0.2 to 0.3 <em>liang</em> are obtained from ore of lesser quality. Once tax,
                        wages
                        and surcharges are deducted, only half of the investment is covered. In the process, the lead
                        juice
                        that
                        flows out is called “melt lumps;” the lead that penetrates into the ashes is called “bottom
                        mother.”
                        All
                        these can be cast to [metallic] lead. If sold, these realize small profits. In Yunnan lead has
                        been
                        treated as a military armament, with punishments by the precedent of illicit trade in salpetre
                        and
                        sulphur. For this reason, smelterers discard all left over cupellation wastes and therefore
                        incur
                        even
                        larger losses. I have investigated lead and found that it has many uses, hammered into tinfoil
                        and
                        treated by firing to make yellow medicinal pills and pigment, actually not only serving to make
                        bullets.
                        Criminal law in fact does not contain a ban of trade in lead. In fact, the Zhazi mines in
                        Guizhou
                        and
                        Longtoushan in Sichuan permit the sale of lead. The same law should apply in Yunnan. If
                        cupellation
                        wastes were permitted to be sold, the miners’ losses on investment could be reduced, which would
                        mean
                        that they will not cease operations and pull out. However, transport storage facilities will be
                        required
                        for selling lead. The amount that is to be carried out of the mines, should be inspected and
                        marked
                        with
                        numbers by the mine official, which would be entered into the license ticket. Upon arrival at
                        the
                        destination, the local government would check against the ticket and hand out payment. By this
                        means,
                        illicit trade would be blocked, while military supplies would not be jeopardized. Using this to
                        generate
                        benefits would indeed provide substantial means to make up for losses.

                        throughout Yunnan province has its “mine rules.” There are altogether seven headmen, and upon
                        opening a
                        mine, these hold council and set up these rules [governing surcharges]. The more items these
                        contain,
                        the worse the exploitation. According to consulted records, the statutes that have been applied
                        throughout state for mines in eastern Yunnan that miners upon selling their ore and by the price
                        they
                        obtain for it, have 15 out of every 100 <em>liang</em> collected as government tax. This is
                        called
                        “raw
                        tax.” In the mines of western Yunnan, the miners pay no tax when selling their ore, but from the
                        silver
                        that is obtained in smelting 12 to 13 out of every 100 <em>liang</em> are collected as tax. This
                        is
                        called “cooked tax.” All revenue of the regular quota has to be reported and remitted in full.
                        In
                        addition, there are the so-called “scattered” surcharges that provide for wages of the headmen,
                        the
                        clerks and runners, as well as many other fees that the headmen impose, increase or reduce as

                        and
                        well-intentioned are one out of ten, while the other nine are violent and cunning. Moreover,
                        burning
                        incense and forming brotherhoods is extremely common in mining communities. According to a
                        Yunnanese
                        proverb, therefore, there is “no mine without incense.” When these [brotherhoods] as set against
                        each
                        other, they will fight for dominance, when they unite, they lord it over the local people and
                        will
                        gradually come to resist the state and disregard the law. For this reason, in an area where a
                        mine
                        is
                        located, it is not only the official who is scared of prosecution and punishment, but gentry and
                        commoners will also abhor and reject the prospect. To promote benefits, evils have to be
                        eradicated
                        first, and this can be accomplished by strictness alone. An example are iron implements:
                        hammers,
                        chisels, pots and kitchen knives have to be admitted, while guns and blades have to be searched
                        for,
                        so
                        that no man carrying them can enter the mines. Seal-bearing officials who are dispatched to
                        reside
                        at
                        mines, are granted the power to set up cangues, bamboo sticks and other devices of punishment.
                        First
                        transgressors should be put in the cangue, or paraded through the street with pierced ears, thus
                        effect
                        deterrence from major crime by minor punishment. If mine bandits form sworn brotherhoods and
                        kill
                        several of their enemies or harass the commoner population by rape and robbery, all prefect,
                        sub-prefects, department and county magistrates together with military officials have to

                    <td>Fourth, blocking scams. Our investigations have shown mines to be always operated by
                        partnerships,
                        with
                        varying numbers of shares. Some are operated by a main investor with additional shareholders, in
                        others
                        partners pool money and in return receive corresponding rights to workings. In any case, these
                        only
                        form
                        when good ore has been spotted. In Yunnan, a type of fraudster is found, who swindle people into
                        investing rice and oil [to develop a mine]. In the ore heaps, they select the purest pieces,
                        which
                        commonly are called “ink green,” “cinnaber,” or “buckwheat flour,” and show them as samples,
                        thus
                        inciting greed for large profits, so that many come forth to invest. Once the fraudster] has
                        contracted
                        for a large sum, he will vanish. The stupid are thus left exhausted, while the cunning cheat
                        them
                        out of
                        their wealth. This is the very reason for which good commoners are afraid of mining. Another
                        [fraudulent
                        practice] occurs in the selling and buying of ore in the mines. Here a type of leech inserts
                        himself,
                        often taking a fraction for himself, who will cover the bottom [in an ore bucket] and exchange
                        good
                        for
                        bad, thus doing great damage to mining matters. Following announcements that ban these
                        practices,
                        criminal offences should be punished heavily, so that the evildoers are warned and exposed to
                        the
                        public.

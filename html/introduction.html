            <p>
                This site provides an overview of premodern Chinese mining terminology based on a memorial by
                the Yunnan provincial government from 1849. The memorial, authored by Lin Zexu and Cheng Yucai,
                offers unique insights into the silver mining practices of the Qing era.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This glossary contains some 50 technical terms on mining, metallurgy and structures within the industry
                that were in use in 19th century southwest China.
            </p>
            <p>
                It covers the terms that occur in a memorial that Lin Zexu 林則徐 (1785–1850) and Cheng Yucai 程矞采
                (1783-1858), the officials presiding the provincial government of Yunnan province, submitted to the
                throne in 1849. The document is entitled “Inspection of the Situation in the Mines and Trial
                Implementation of Exploitation Development” 查勘礦廠情形試行開採摺 and reports on silver mining in the
                province.
            </p>
            <p>
                The text is a core source on silver mining in Yunnan province during the Qing period because it contains
                much specific information that appears in no other surviving record. Because it dates shortly before the
                devastating mid-19th-century civil wars, which brought the dynasty to the brink of collapse, the text
                moreover marks the final point in a textualization process of traditional mining knowledge.

            <h2>Glossary</h2>
            <p>
                To explore the formation of the terms, the glossary draws on texts on mining in southwest China from the
                period between the early 17th century and about 1900 and digitized full-text collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                It provides my translation of the terms, notes on uses and semantic fields, linked occurrences in 14 key
                texts, and preliminary classifications.

            </p>
            <p>
                You can use the glossary like a dictionary, searching alphabetically by pronunciation.

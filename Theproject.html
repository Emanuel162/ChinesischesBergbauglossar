            <h2>The Project and Its Methodology</h2>
            <p>
               Mining terminology in use in southwest China begins appearing in scattered records in the early 18th century and is documented in a small body of sources dating from roughly 1820 to 1850. It thus constitutes a rare case in which textualization of technological knowledge becomes visible in in late imperial Chinese records. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This glossary focusses on the memorial entitled “Inspection of the Situation in the Mines and Trial Implementation of Exploitation Development” 查勘礦廠情形試行開採摺, in which the Yunnan government reported on the silver mines in the province in 1849. It uses this late document as the point of departure for exploring meanings and shifts in terms through the small body of other texts that record technologies and specific arrangements in mining communities, companies, and administrative structures of control and taxation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, it uses the full-text databases of records and gazetteers, such as the Diaolong database and Zhongguo fangzhiku for research on occurrences and 14 core texts to pursue usages and semantic fields.
            </p>
            <p>
            The geographic region and traceable regionally specific expressions, moreover, invite considering possibilities of an integrated empire-wide knowledge network or the existence of regional traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Preliminary analytical tags attempt using the tool to explore the outlines questions. One of these identifies errors in the terms used in the memorial. Another classifies types of terms, differentiating between trade terms that may by specific to the region, older “literary” terms, and administrative terms, thus providing indications on regional characteristics and input by practitioners.

            <h2>Sources</h2>
            <p>
                <strong> The memorial of 1849</strong> has been transmitted in several editions that slightly diverge in a few rare characters. In all cases in doubt, this investigation follows the archive copy of the original memorial that was produced for presentation at court and deposited in the Qing imperial archive. This copy, which is preserved in the First Archive in Beijing is published as photographic reproduction in <em>Qinggong Lin Zexu dang'an huibian</em> 清宮林則徐檔案匯編, vol. 10, 97-117. The interpunctuation draws on <em>Lin Zexu quanji </em>林则徐全集 2002, part <em>Zouzhe</em> 奏折, vol. 4, 493-500. The original text is unstructured. I have used the subdivision into paragraphs that Zheng Zhenduo 鄭振鐸 (1898-1958) added in <em>WanQing wenxuan</em>, with one added subdivision..

            <h2>Other Texts</h2>
            <p>
              The core text on mining terminology is first section of <em>Diannan kuangchang tulue</em> 滇南礦廠圖略, the handbook of the Yunnan mining administration that Wu Qijun 吳其濬 (1789-1847) commissioned in 1844. Together with the illustrations in this work, I attribute this section, which is entitled <em>Diankuang tulue </em>滇礦圖略, to Xu Jinsheng 徐金生 (?-c. 1840), a local official who served in Yunnan for over a decade. The text is a topical descriptive glossary of some 200 terms. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The analysis uses 13 earlier texts and one later work. All earlier texts are from Yunnan province, and the majority were included in the handbook of 1844. Pursuing occurrences and usages in this body of texts thus allows tracing their formation. Because the texts were evidently or probably available to the authors of the 1849 memorial, the analysis also helps gaining insights the memorial’s sources and ways in which these were used. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The earliest text is the chapter on silver metallurgy in Song Yinxing’s 宋應星 (1587-1666) encyclopaedia <em>Tiangong kaiwu </em>天工開物. This late Ming text, which for the most part is not geographically defined but records some Yunnannese technologies, mainly serves as a reference to older terminology. As this chapter was included in the 1844 handbook, it was also evidently accessible to the memorial authors. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The earliest Qing source is an only vaguely dated description of the silver and tin mines of Gejiu that was included in the 1712 local gazetteer of Mengzi. It probably dates to the period of compilation, although a considerably earlier period cannot be excluded. The same section with slight differences is also recorded in the massive encyclopaedic collection <em>Gujin tushu jicheng </em>古今圖書集成, which was compiled 1700-1725 an mainly contains materials up to about 1700.
            </p>
            <p>
            Relatively specific records begin in the 1770s with a surviving excerpt from a lost handbook of the provincial copper administration. Two memorials on the copper mines of Yunnan province of 1777 and 1795 have been included to provide earlier examples of reporting on mining matters. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Further specific records composed by officials or in the context of government tasks but not for administrative purposes are articles on by Ni Shenshu and Wang Song, and poems by Wang Taiyue and Wu Zhenyu. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The latest included text is a report by Huang Mengju 黄梦菊, the magistrate of Huize county in northeastern Yunnan of about 1845.
            </p>
            <p>
               Song Gengping 宋賡平, a Western-educated mining engineer, recorded traditional technologies that he observed in western Sichuan around 1900 in a textbook to be used at a mining school in Chongqing. The work by an outsider to the traditional world of mining and metallurgy with scientific knowledge and linguistic understanding is of invaluable help for understanding late premodern mining technologies and terminologies in the region. Because western Sichuan borders on northeastern and northern Yunnan, the region may be regarded as largely continuous in terms of technologies and terminologies.
